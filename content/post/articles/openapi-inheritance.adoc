We have to create a new API with inheritance in the model.
To continue with the contract first way,
we will see how to write it in OAS3.
<!--more-->

== The requirement

We will create an API that can (surprise) manage ponies.
We will work with two kinds of ponies, pegasi and unicorn.

== The solution

We must use allOf for inheritance:

{{< accordion title="api.yml" id="api" >}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
---
components:
  schemas:
    Pony:
      type: "object"
      properties:
        name:
          type: "string"
    Pegasi:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            wingsColors:
              type: "string"
              default: "RED"
    Unicorn:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            cornSize:
              type: "integer"
              default: 10
---
{{< / highlight >}}
{{< / accordion >}}


With this, we will have Pegasi and Unicorn that extend Pony.
But if we generate the controller,
it will not work well because it can't say when to build a Pegasi or a Unicorn.

To specify this we need to use a discriminator.


{{< accordion title="api.yml" id="api-discriminator" >}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
---
components:
  schemas:
    Pony:
      discriminator:
        propertyName: ponyType
      type: "object"
      properties:
        name:
          type: "string"
        ponyType:
          type: string

    Pegasi:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            wingsColors:
              type: "string"
              default: "RED"
    Unicorn:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            cornSize:
              type: "integer"
              default: 10
---
{{< / highlight >}}
{{< / accordion >}}


The discriminator is added to the model because it will be in.
It must not be treated as a hidden property because it will mess clients.

If you want to fix it,
it can be specified with mapping property.


{{< accordion title="api.yml" id="api-discriminator-mapping" >}}
{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
---
components:
  schemas:
    Pony:
      discriminator:
        propertyName: ponyType
        mapping:
          pegasi: "#/components/schemas/Pegasi"
          unicorn: "#/components/schemas/Unicorn"
      type: "object"
      properties:
        name:
          type: "string"
        ponyType:
          type: string

    Pegasi:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            wingsColors:
              type: "string"
              default: "RED"
    Unicorn:
      allOf:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Pony"
        - type: "object"
          properties:
            cornSize:
              type: "integer"
              default: 10
---
{{< / highlight >}}
{{< / accordion >}}

== OneOf?

Our first try was with oneOf,
but it's not for inheritance it's a composition,
it's create an object that can be both a Pegasi and a Unicorn,
but in a way that says Pegasi and Unicorn are two disjoint objects with nothing common.
